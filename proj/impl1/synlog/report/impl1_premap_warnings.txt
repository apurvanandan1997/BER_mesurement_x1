@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT531 :"/home/apurvan/GSoC/usb-plug-mod-working/BER_mesurement_x1/src/top.vhd":162:4:162:13|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 1 sequential elements including fifo_rd_en.  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance.
